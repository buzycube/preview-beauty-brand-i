# Beauty Brand Template Preview - I

Welcome to the beauty-brand-demo repository! This is a demonstration website for a fictional beauty brand, showcasing the brand's products and collections. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes a variety of open-source libraries and frameworks. The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of how a real-world beauty brand's website could be implemented and to serve as a starting point for developers looking to build their own beauty brand website. The website is designed with an elegant and sophisticated aesthetic, providing an engaging user experience. It showcases product galleries, customer reviews, and a shopping cart feature. Feel free to use and modify the code as you see fit, and let us know if you have any questions or suggestions!
